This plugin allows you to capture code coverage information from [EnForce gradle plugin](https://github.com/Jalasoft/enforce-gradle-plugin). 
Jenkins will generate the code coverage percentage from your organization and a pie chart that represents a summary about code coverage by test classes according to ranges defined. The EnForce jenkins plugin can be [downloaded here]().
