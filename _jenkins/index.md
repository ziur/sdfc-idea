This plugin allows you to capture code coverage information from [EnForce gradle plugin](https://github.com/Jalasoft/enforce-gradle-plugin). 

Jenkins will generate:
* Coverage percentage. 
* A pie chart about unit test percentage in ranges defined as: 

    *Danger (0% - 74%)
    
    *Risk (75% - 79%)
    
    *Acceptable (80% - 94%)
    
    *Safe(95% - 100%)


The EnForce jenkins plugin can be [downloaded here]().
