### Basically

# because there are no out the box support for Continuous Integration on Salesforce.

- Migration Tool is a basic tool that cannot support complex deployment scenarios where the source code has dependencies between its elements (classes, pages, objects).
- No easy way to upload or retrieve code from a Salesforce Organization.
- There are no available tools for junit reports or coverage reports.

Sounds good? Let's go!
