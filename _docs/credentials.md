## Management credential profile

To deploy code into an organization you need a credential, for so you should create an account in SalesForce.

To management your credentials there are two files called credentials.dat located one in your project directory another one in user home directory where your credentials are saved as json format with the next fields:
<ol>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>id</strong> is necessary to management your credential.</li>
		<li><strong>username</strong> is a SalesForce account.</li>
		<li><strong>password</strong> is your SalesForce password</li>
		<li><strong>token</strong> is your SalesForce token</li>
		<li><strong>sfdcType</strong> is a login type.</li>
		<li><strong>type</strong> is define if your credential is encrypted or no.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
