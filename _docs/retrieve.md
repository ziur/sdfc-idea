>***Note:*** This property only support folders name.

## Executing Retrieve task

Once retrieve task is executed without parameters It uses package xml to retrieve files from your organization.

	$ gradle retrieve

### Without package xml file

Once retrieve task is executed and there isn't a package xml it retrieves files by default:

* objects
* staticresources

We can set those values for ONLY THE FOLDERS that we want to retrieve.
The only thing that we have to do is:

* Add in the build.gradle file, the line with the next content.
```
	foldersToDownload = "classes,pages"
```
 
 * This means that folders which will be retrieved are classes and pages, you can add folders as you want to recover them.
```
        foldersToDownload = classes,triggers,pages...
```

### Using files parameter

Folders:      
      
      $ gradle retrieve -Pfiles=objects
      $ gradle retrieve -Pfiles=objects,triggers
      
Files and folders:

      $ gradle retrieve -Pfiles=objects,classes/Class1.cls
      $ gradle retrieve -Pfiles=objects,triggers,triggers/Trigger1.trigger,classes/Class1.cls
